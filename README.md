# theodore
> multi-page markdown-based wiki, sibling of [theodora](#https://github.com/SeedyROM/theodora)

By making the wiki multi-page, the design can be simpler, the implementation and use can be more straight-forward, and the pages can be indexed by search engines.

## Todo

- write the back-end to receive requests and serve files
- transform markdown files into html before serving
- find an easy way to inject the rendered html into a template, jade? nunjucks?
- side nav - table of contents and file list
